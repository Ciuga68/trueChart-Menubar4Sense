== Introduction

{tcmenu} is an extension for _Qlik Sense_ that provides a customizable menu bar for centralized navigation, interaction and selection using buttons and select lists based on existing data and utilizing individually configurable actions such as '`Go to a certain sheet`' that can be attached to triggers like '`when the item is clicked`' or '`when the item is loaded`'.

=== What is new in {tcmenu} ##VERSION?

With {tcmenu} ##VERSION, we introduced the support of Qlik Sense PDF export. In addition, Master Dimensions, Drilldown Dimensions, and expression based
dimensions are now supported. It is now also possible to hide elements by condition.

[CAUTION]
An upgrade to the current version requires a migration. If this migration is not done carefully, apps may break. The procedure is described in detail in
 chapter 1.1.3.

==== Features and Improvements

[.text-left]
* [HICO-2178] - Support of Sense PDF export function for TC-Menu
* [HICO-2524] - Improvement when using master item dimensions and expression-based +
                dimensions
* [HICO-2560] - Support of DrillDown-Dimensions in Selections (Single,Sense and Multi)
* [HICO-2601] - Specify expressions for dimension defintion directly
* [HICO-2889] - Technical (MashUp) or visible (on the object) titel, subtitle or footnote
* [HICO-2890] - Conditional display and hiding of menu elements
* [HICO-40445] - Mark button+ actions for sequential or parallel execution (Execute in order)
* [HICO-40461] - New position of edit button state in properties panel
* [HICO-40463] - Performance: Reduced intial loading time (due to reduced count of extension assets)

==== Bugfixes

* [HICO-2726] - Menubar destroys representation of Sense filter pane objects in same sheet
* [HICO-2905] - Button+ UI code editor not working
* [HICO-2939] - [JS-Exception] due to incorrect default value expressions in single select items
* [HICO-40454] - Custom actions are not visible initially after reopening button+ editor
* [HICO-40487] - [JS-Exception] TypeError: Cannot read property 'layout' of undefined

==== Migrate to {tcmenu} ##VERSION

The new {tcmenu} release introduces the support of master and dynamic dimensions.
To use this awesome feature, you have to be sure that all expressions
correspond to the expression syntax known from _Qlik Sense_, which means:

* No `'` or `"` before and after field or dimension names
* Expressions should begin with `=`
* Correct spelling (upper-/lowercase) of field or dimension names

After updating, {tcmenu} will guide you through this process.
At first, navigate to the sheets where you use {tcmenu}.
Now, it will automaticly check if you use expressions somewhere.
If so, you will see the dialog below. Please make sure that all expressions comply with the above mentioned specifications.
Once you have done this, you can confirm by clicking on the appropriate button.
Only when all expressions have been confirmed, you are able to save the changes and close the dialog.

.The dialog that leads you trough the migration process
image::version1_1-migration-dialog.png[migration dialog, 320]

[discrete]
===== Automatic migration for published apps in production

Changes to a published app cannot be persisted. So it is necessary to perform the migration in another way:

.Process to migrate published apps
image::migration-procedure.png[migration procedure, 670]

1. Install the new {tcmenu} version in your testing environment.
2. Now open all relevant apps. Check and confirm all expressions. But you will not be able to perform the save operation.
3. Unzip the `tcmenu.zip` and copy the content of all apps from the _Config settings_ dialog in between the curly brackets at _expressionMigration_.
   Make sure that the existing format is maintained.
4. Finally, zip the complete `tcmenu` directory and upload the ZIP file to the _Qlik Management Console_ on the production environment.
   For all expressions in the config file you will not be asked to reconfirm them.

[CAUTION]
====
When you are using {tcmenu} in a publicated app or in mutiple apps with the same expressions, we recommend to update the `config.js`.
The advantage of this variant is that expressions added in the config file do not have to be reconfirmed.

[underline]#For published apps, this is the only way to persist changes on the expressions.#
====

[CAUTION]
An update to the latest version of the {tcmenu} without prior adjustment of the dimension expressions
leads to incorrect evaluation of the dimensions and therefore corrupt published apps!

== Installing {tcmenu}

=== Installation on _Qlik Sense Desktop_

To install {tcmenu} for _Qlik Sense Desktop_, you just have to put the contents of the {tcmenu} ZIP file into the directory `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Qlik\Sense\Extensions`.

=== Installation on _Qlik Sense Server_

To install {tcmenu} for _Qlik Sense Server_, go into the _Qlik Sense Management Console_ (QMC) and navigate to _Extensions_ via the sidebar. Then click on the _Import_ button which opens the _Import extension file_ dialog where you can browse and import the {tcmenu} ZIP file.

.Importing the extension ZIP file in the QMC.

== Creating a new menu bar

After installing {tcmenu} you can add a new menu bar to your sheet in _Edit mode_ by dragging the entry from the extension sidebar into your sheet. You can add as many menus to your sheet as you need and each can be set up differently.

[[new-menu]]
.A new empty menu bar
image::new-menu.png[new-menu,200]

{tcmenu} features three panes in the properties panel -- _Dimensions_, _Items_, and _Appearance_ -- which are covered in the following sections.

<<<
== Defining dimensions in the _Dimensions_ pane

The _Dimensions_ pane is used to define all the dimensions needed for the _Select_ items of {tcmenu}.

Dimensions can be added in the way known from Qlik Sense. The dimensionâ€™s name is subsequently used as the Dimension Title. This value is only for usage in
 trueChart Menubar and can be changed if desired.

.Adding a new dimension to the menu.
image::adding-dimensions.png[adding-dimensions, 250]

The dimensions defined here can be later used in the _Single Select_, _Multi Select_ or _Sense Select_ items.

.Using the predefined dimensions in a Single Select.
image::dimensions-select.png[adding-dimensions]

=== Sorting

The sorting of dimensions can be edited in the _Sorting_ pane.

The sort order can be set to _Automatic_ or _User Defined_. When the latter is chosen, you can set your desired sorting order which can be one or multiple of:

Load Order:: This is the original order of the records in the data source.
Selection State:: Shows the currently selected values first. For _Sense Selects_ this is the default.
Frequency:: Sorts the values by the frequency of occurrence.
Numeric:: Sorts the values numerically.
Alphabet:: Sorts the values alphabetically.
Expression:: Use a custom expression to control sorting.

.User-defined sorting options for dimensions
image::dimensions-sorting.png[dimensions-sorting,200]

<<<
== Items of {tcmenu}

=== Adding items

{tcmenu} features seven different item types:

* Button
* Button Container
* Button Dropdown
* Multi Select
* Single Select
* Sense Select
* Variable Dropdown

To create a new item, open _Items_ in the properties panel and click on _Add Items_. This will create a new _Button Container_ including a new button called _My Button_ by default. The item type can be changed by clicking on the _Type_ drop-down list, which gives you the selection between the different types mentioned above.

.Adding items
image::add-item.png[add-item,200]

.Initial items
image::initial-items.png[initial-items,200]

The first thing you want to do every time you create a new item is giving them distinctive names in the properties panel by using the field _Name (only Property Panel)_. This will help you to identify your items in the properties panel when the configuration of your menu bar grows larger.

==== Reoccurring properties

There are some properties that {tcmenu}'s items have in common. These are:

|====
| Name (only Property Panel) | This is the name of the item used in the property panel.
| Show condition | This element will only be shown if this condition evaluates to true.
| Use Custom Size | By default,  the item spans over the entire available area. Set this to _Custom_ to define a custom height or width depending on the menu's orientation.
| Text Layout | Can be set to _Single_ for a single line or _Multi_ for a multi-line to show a selection in a _Select_ item.
| Label: Alignment horizontal | Sets the horizontal alignment of the item's label.
| Label: Alignment Vertical | Sets the vertical alignment of the item's label.
| Selection Label | For selectable items sets the preferred label of the selection displayed on the item.
| Icon | Many item labels can have icons you can select from a list.
| Tooltip | The tooltip's text to appear when the user hovers over the item.
|====

=== Buttons

_Buttons_ are grouped by states that are defined by conditional expressions. This allows you to use different settings for the button depending on which of the given conditions is true.

.Default properties of a newly created button with one state. Additional states can be created by clicking on Add State.
image::default-button.png[default-button]

NOTE: If more than one condition returns `true` at the same time the first (i.e. uppermost) state will be chosen.

TIP: If you don't need your button to act differently on given conditions just use a single state with the condition `='true'` which is also the default when creating a new button.

==== The Button Editor

The _Button Editor_ is a powerful tool for setting both a button's appearance and its behavior, i.e. the action triggered when the button is pressed. It will be opened when you click on _State Settings_ in one of the button's states.

===== Features

The settings are divided into five categories (General, Layout, Style, Color and Actions) covered in the following sections.

====== General

The _General_ tab features five options:

.Type
The _Type_ list gives you a selection of various predefined button appearances, all of which can be fine-tuned in the adjacent tabs. Apart from that, you can choose between _simple_, _image_, and _custom_ in the _General_ section. The latter two of which can be used to create an image-based or custom-CSS-based button respectively.

.State
The _State_ list is a sub-list of the _Type_ list and covers the _normal_, _active_ and _disabled_ state of the previously chosen type.

.Icon
Using the _Icon_ option you can define an additional icon for the button out of the Font Awesome or Qlik Sense icon repository.

.Text
The _Text_ field is the text used as the label on the button.

.Tooltip
With the _Tooltip_ option, you can define the text shown when the user hovers over the button.

[TIP]
Help other users to understand your button's effect by describing it in the tooltip.

.The Button Editor showing the first tab (General).
image::button-general.png[button-general]

.Image
If you've chosen the _image_ type you can additionally define an _Image url_, the _Position_, and _Size_ of your background image in the _Image_ section.

.The Button Editor as Image type with specific input elements.
image::image-button-editor.png[image-button-editor]

To be able to display images with an image button, these images must first be saved (uploaded) to the trueChart Image Library and selected from there. All images of the trueChart Image Library are stored within the Sense app and are automatically available in duplicated and exported apps.

[CAUTION]
The trueChart Image Library could not changed in published apps since theese are read only in Sense. Existiing images still could be reused.

.The trueChart Image Libary dialog to import, export, insert, rename and delete images.
image::trueChart-media-library.png[trueChart-media-library]

The trueChart Image Library offers the possibility to import images from different sources, so you can take pictures from the Sense media libraries, upload one or more files directly or via a URL.
Other features available in the trueChart Image Library are: Rename, Replace / Update, Delete. The image download is not supported in ie11.

[CAUTION]
Since the contents of the image library are saved globally in an app, they can not be copied to an other app when copying an extension object.
The recommended way to do this is: first export the necessary images in the source app and then import them again into the target mage library. Since the used image has the same names, these images then will be displayed correctly in the copied objects.

.Custom css
If you've chosen the _custom_ type you can define your own CSS rules on the button, giving you the maximal flexibility for the button's appearance.

====== Layout

The _Layout_ tab is for defining the metrics of the button. You can set...

.Dimension
In the _Dimension_ section, you can set the width and height of the button inside its boundaries. This is set to `100%` by default but can be set to any value using CSS units or `auto` to make the button as large as its contents demands.

.Position
In the _Position_ section, you can set the horizontal and vertical alignment of the button inside its boundaries, which is only effective if the respective width or height is set to a value other than `100%`.

.Content alignment
In the _Content alignment_ section, you can define the alignment of the button's text and the icon. The _Text_ alignment is only effective for multiple lines of text on the button.

.Content position
In the _Content position_ section, you can set the horizontal and vertical alignment of the content itself (i.e. the text and the icon together). This is only effective if the respective width or height of the button is not set to `auto`.

.Padding
With the _Padding_ setting, you can disable a predefined padding by choosing _Off_ or override the default padding by choosing _On_ which allows you to set the values in CSS `padding` syntax.

.Margin
With the _Margin_ setting, you can disable a predefined margin by choosing _Off_ or override the default margin by choosing _On_ which allows you to set the values in CSS `margin` syntax.

.An example showing the different layout settings and its effects on the button's appearance.
image::button-layout.png[button-layout]

====== Style

In the _Style_ tab, you can set the visual appearance of the button's content including:

.Font settings
In the _Font_ section, you can set the font properties, i.e. _Family_, _Weight_, _Style_, and _Size_.

.Icon size
Icons have a fixed size, but you can change the scaling in the _Icon_ section using the _Size_ slider to choose between 1x, 1.5x, 2x, 3x, 4x or 5x.

.Background repetition
If you defined a background on your button you can control how the background is repeated with the _Repeat_ setting in the _Background_ section.

.Border
With the _Border_ setting, you can disable a predefined border by choosing _Off_ or override the default border by choosing _On_ which allows you to set the border's color, radius, width, and style. The radius is given in CSS `border-radius` syntax.

.Shadow
The same applies for the button's shadow in the _Shadow_ section. By using _On_ you can define a custom border according to the CSS `box-shadow` syntax: +
`none|_h-shadow v-shadow blur spread color_ |inset|initial|inherit`.

.An example showing the different style settings and its effects on the button's appearance.
image::button-style.png[button-style]

====== Color

The _Color_ tab is used to set the colors for the _normal_ and _hover_ state of the button. This overrides the colors you've set in the _Colors_ section of the _Appearance_ pane and those given by the button type in the _General_ tab of the _Button Editor_. For a detailed list of accepted color expressions, refer to Appendix A.1.

.An example showing the different color settings and its effects on the button's appearance with the button in the hover state.
image::button-color-hover.png[button-style]

====== Actions

In the _Actions_ tab, you can define triggers, that is the actions to take effect when a certain event on the button is triggered.

Possible events to attach actions are:

On click:: Triggered when the user clicks the button.

[CAUTION]
Buttons without triggers and actions, for example, when used as text or image placeholders, do not apply hover effects. In order to achieve this behavior, all triggers must be removed via the delete icon.

Before navigation:: Triggered when the sheet is closed or changed.
On load:: Triggered when the element loads. This can be used to define initial actions like making selections.

[CAUTION]
To avoid critical actions being scattered all over other different items, _On load_ actions like those for initial selections should be defined on a designated element (such as an otherwise non-functional button that serves to show the company's logo).

On selection:: Triggered when the button is selected.
Custom:: Define your own event you can give a custom name. This can be used by involving `HiCo.performCustomTrigger("_triggername_", "_triggerdata_")` in a custom action.

For every event, you can define one or multiple actions, such as _Go to sheet_ to change the view to a different sheet or _Select match_ to alter the current selection.

A full list of provided actions can be found in Appendix B.

.This example establishes an action that sets the City field to New York for the current selection on click of the button.
image::button-action.png[button-action]

====== Execution Order

Actions of a specific trigger are executed in the order they are defined (from top to bottom) without explicitly waiting for each other to be finished before executing the next one. In case of asynchronous calls this may lead to a different execution order.

For most actions (like selecting fields, setting variables, etc.) this is the best option, because they will be performed as fast as possible. This leads to less requests to the "Qlik Sense Engine" and results in better performance/stability.

For use cases were the execution order is important, every action can be defined as "sequential" where the execution order will then be respected, by executing them one by one.

==== Using Expressions

Apart from static values, every input box that features Qlik Sense's _fx_ icon also accepts Sense expressions.

=== Arranging buttons using _Button Container_

The _Button Container_ is an item to group multiple buttons together while inverting the orientation. That means, if your menu is oriented vertically, the buttons in the container will be arranged horizontally and vice verse.

.A vertically and horizontally arranged menu bar, each featuring two plain buttons and another two buttons in a Button Container in between.
image::ver-hor-menu.png[ver-hor-menu,800]

=== Button Dropdown

The _Button Dropdown_ is a drop-down list that contains a variable number of buttons that will unfold after the user clicks the dropdown element and are otherwise hidden. The buttons are added in the same fashion as in a _Button Container_.

=== Selects

_Selects_ are drop-down lists that can be prefilled with existing data from previously defined dimensions. {tcmenu} offers three different types of selects, explained in the following sections.

==== Single Select

A _Single Select_ is a drop-down list that allows the user to make selections for *one* dimension defined in the _Dimension_ input box.

.Examples for a Single Select when using dimension without drilldown (left) and with drilldown-dimensions (right)
image::comparison-single-select-with-drilldowns.png[single-select, 450]

The element can have a custom icon defined via the _Icon_ list and label using the _Label_ input box. The latter can be arranged by using the label alignment options for horizontal and vertical alignment (_Label: Alignment Horizontal_ and _Label: Alignment Vertical_).

The _Text Layout_ option can be set to either _Single_ or _Multi_ which switches between a single-line and multi-line arrangement of label and selection label.

The _Single Select_ item also allows to set a _Default Value_ from a fixed string or a evaluated expression. This value is automatically set when opening or changing to the sheet and can be changed afterwards but ensures that the corresponding dimension can never be unset in the selection.

.Properties of Single Select with some example settings.
image::single-select-prop.png[single-select-prop, 200]

Just like the _Label_, the _Selection Label_ is customizable. By default (_Predefined_) it shows the current selection or the number of items selected if they don't fit on the element, but can be also set to a custom values or expression.

If you use the _Single Select_ with drilldown dimensions, you get some more options:

[%header,cols="^.^45, <.^625"]
|===

| Icon
| Functionality

| image:icon-drillup-return.png[icon-drillup-return, 30]
| The _arrow left_ icon clears the selection on the lowest level.

| image:icon-drillup-field-select.png[icon-drillup-field-select, 30]
| When you click on the _field select_ icon, select a certain level. Selections below this level will be removed.

|===

==== Multi Select

The _Multi Select_ is a drop-down list that allows the user to make selections from *more* than one dimension at the same time. Just like the _Button Container_, it can be seen as an item containing multiple _Single Selects_, each configurable independently.

To do so, the properties panel features a button _Add Single Select_ to add as many _Single Select_ items to the _Multi Select_ as desired. They are configured the same way as stand-alone _Single Select_ items.

Apart from that, you can set the same text and layout options for the parent _Multi Select_ as for a _Single Select_.

.A simple Multi Select for two dimensions, City, and Customer, called '`City & Customer.`'
image::multi-select.png[multi-select,300]

==== Sense Select

_Sense Selects_ use the native selection widget of Qlik Sense and is otherwise configured the same way as a _Single Select_ but you cannot define a default value.

.Examples for a Sense Select when using dimension without drilldown (right) and drilldown-dimensions (left)
image::comparison-sense-select-with-drilldowns.png[sense-select, 450]

For drilldown dimensions, the same settings apply as when used in a _Single Select_ item.

=== Variable Dropdown

The _Variable Dropdown_ element is a drop-down list that allows setting custom values to Qlik Sense variables. Every item in the list represents a value that will be set when the user selects the item. These variables can be used to control other aspects of your apps.

.The definition for a variable value in the properties panel setting the number `10` to the defined variable `results`.
image::variable-dropdown-var.png[variable-dropdown-var,150]

Before using variables you need to create them. This can be done by opening _Variables_ and clicking the _Create new_ button to create a new variable.

.Creating a new variable in the Variables dialog.
image::creating-variable.png[creating-variable,500]

In the properties panel of the _Variable Dropdown_ element, define the variable name in the _Variable Name_ input box and add as many selectable values as desired by clicking on _Add Variable Value_. There you can define the value itself, the label and all the custom alignment settings for each of the added values separately.

.A bar chart that uses a variable as the number of displayed results.
image::bar-chart-variable.png[bar-chart-variable]

<<<
== The _Add-ons_ pane

In the _Data handling_ section of the _Add-ons_ pane there are two options to control calculation and rendering of either {tcmenu} itself or other charts/extensions that support _calculation conditions_.

.Calculation condition
Use the _Calculation condition_ input box to define a Sense variable that is checked to be `true` before the actual rendering ('`calculation`') takes place. It's also possible to use any function or expression here. The _Displayed message_ is the message to be shown unless the condition is `true` and can be customized.

.Calculation condition variable
The _Calculation condition variable_ is the opposite of the _Calculation condition_: It is do define a variable that is set to `true` as soon as {tcmenu} initialized all the default selections you may have set in _Single Selects_ and to be used by other extensions supporting this _Data handling_ feature.

.The calculation condition properties in the _Data handling_ section.

<<<
== The _Appearance_ pane

=== General

The _General_ pane features the following options:

* Show titles
  - Show titles (title, subtitle and footnote) in the menu box.
* Title
  - Enter a title for the menu bar. The title is also displayed above the menu when _Show titles_ is set to _On_.
* Subtitle and Footnote
  - Enter and display an additional subtitle and footnote (only if _Show titles_ is set to _On_).
* Show details
  - This option has currently no effects.

=== Layout

.Orientation
Define the orientation of the menu which can be either horizontal or vertical. This has no effect on small mobile devices where the orientation is adjusted automatically to vertical.

.Width Setting
When the menu is oriented vertically the items can be set to be stretched to the maximum width (_Fill_) or you can define a custom width (_Custom_).

.Height Setting
When the menu is oriented horizontally the menu bar can take all the available height (_Fill_) or you can define a custom height (_Custom_).

In vertical orientation this setting is used to use the background color over entire height (_Fill_) or only to the last menu item (_Automatic_).

.The _Layout_ section in the _Appearance_ pane
image::appearance-layout.png[appearance-layout,200]

=== Position

In the _Position_ section, you can set the position of the menu bar inside its boundaries when the width or height is set to values in pixel other than _Automatic_. For example, the value 0 for Top removes the distance to the edge or next object above the menu completely.

.The _Position_ section showing default and individual settings.
image::appearance-position.png[appearance-position,200]

=== Colors

The _Colors_ section is to define the default colors of the menu to be inherited by its items. These can be configured by entering color expressions, setting predefined colors or choosing with the color picker. For a detailed list of accepted color expressions, refer to Appendix A.1.

.Part of the _Colors_ section in the _Appearance_ pane showing preselected colors and the color picker.
image::appearance-colors.png[appearance-colors,200]

=== Text

The _Text_ section features all settings to take effect on the font, such as:

* Font family
* Font weight
* Font style
* Font size

These are set separately for general _Labels_ and also _Selection Labels_, i.e. selected values showing on {tcmenu}'s elements.

.The _Text_ section in the _Appearance_ pane.
image::appearance-text.png[appearance-text,200]

=== Display

In the _Display_ section, you can set the visibility of the Sense menu, selection, and title bar. The bars can be permanently hidden (_Hide_), displayed (_Show_ = default setting) or (not) displayed depending on an expression.

[TIP]
If the Sense menu is not visible and the Edit mode is not available for this reason, it can be simply activated by Ctrl + E.

[CAUTION]
When using several menu objects on a sheet, ensure that all menus are defined identically for these settings. Otherwise, one menu could hide a bar and another could show this bar again, depending on which menu object is loaded as last one by Sense.

                       he must also specify the sorting by selection status. With this sort, the selection behavior
                       corresponds to the Qlik Sense standard.
                     * The recommendation is to define sorting by selection status for Sense Selects and
                       never for single selection (corresponds to the automatic behavior).
